Currently I'm finishing tha last project at 42RomaLuiss School, where I have to build a website for the mighty pong contest with other teammates. 
In specific, my task is to take care of the frontend part,
therefore also of the graphics of the website. First of all with my team we decided how the
site was going to be like. And here's the problem: we were very undecided of what style to
use for the website. So I proposed myself to create three examples of templates with
different design for each.
But It was the first time that I had to create a template website, so what I did?
I asked to colleagues for some advice and I did a lot of research on the Internet to understand
how a website can be both easthetic but easily usable for users and for this I took a course
in UI UX Design on Udemy and finally It was time to put into practice what I learned.
To create realistic prototypes of the website I choose to use Adobe XD.
A week later I presented my works but once again they were undecided, so I
suggested a short brainstorming where they had to tell me which elements they liked most
in the templates so that I could to try to combine them in a single site template.
And finally the problem was solved and everyone was pleased with the result!
